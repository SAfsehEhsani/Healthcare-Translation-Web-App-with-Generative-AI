# Healthcare-Translation-Web-App-with-Generative-AI


A real-time multilingual **voice translation app** designed for **patients and healthcare providers**. This prototype leverages **Generative AI**, **Web Speech API**, and **text-to-speech synthesis** to break language barriers in clinical environments.

---

##  Project Overview

This project is a 48-hour prototype challenge to build a healthcare translation app that can:

- Convert **spoken medical input** into a **text transcript**
- Translate that transcript into a **target language** using **Generative AI (Groq)**
- Provide **text-to-speech playback** of the translation
- Run in **mobile-first, browser-based environments** (Streamlit)
